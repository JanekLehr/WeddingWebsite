# Honeymoon
After the wedding we will be flying to Crimea, Ukraine (Russia if you Putin that way) to visit Zeineb's family for a couple 
weeks. Due to immigration issues they are unable to come to the United States, so we will come to them! Janek will start 
out making a fool of himself trying to speak Russian but will of course come back a fluent speaker.

After Crimea we plan to spend a week visiting a country nearby. Italy, Hungary, and Croatia are the candidates so far! 
If you would like to contribute to making our honeymoon extra special we would greatly appreciate it! We promise pictures 
and stories in return!
