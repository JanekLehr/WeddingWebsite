# Honeymoon
After the wedding we will be flying to Crimea, Ukraine (Russia if you're Putin it that way) to visit Zeineb's family for 
a couple of weeks. Janek will start out by making a fool of himself trying to speak Russian but will, of course, come 
back a fluent speaker.

After Crimea we plan to spend a week traveling around. Italy, Hungary, and Croatia are the candidates so far! 
If you would like to contribute to making our honeymoon extra special we would greatly appreciate it. We promise pictures 
and stories in return!
